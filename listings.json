    "description": "I'm a 26-year-old woman who works full time and loves living in a cozy, homey place. I'm an interior designer with a passion for design, the beach, and furniture restoration. I like to hang outdoors or listening to music. My house vibes are chill and occasionally social, im a very easy-going person and but still prioritise a clean lifestyle. Positivity is extremely important to me. I have a cat she is the biggest cuddler and loves to sit on your lap and enjoy pets. I‚Äôve had her for 13 years so we have a very strong bond and she is well behaved and house trained. Also flexible with my weekly rent budget. \n\nCurrently leaving my home as they are selling the house but have lived here since I moved from qld for four years and loved every minute! Just looking for the same comfortable home as I have now. \n\nI do have a partner who I would like to stay over 2-3 nights a week but I will also be staying at his place 2-3 nights a week so utilities would even out. He is a very respectful person and gets along with everyone. \n\nI also work in joinery manufacturing so having me in your home comes with some perks! Let me know if you plan to renovate! üè†üè†",

My cat is indoor (litter trained), she is very friendly and loves people! I occasionally take her outside from time to time.\nI am currently working at a tobacconist and enjoy it and looking to do more study once I settle in somewhere. In my free time I go to the beach, Pilates, read books, go out for brunch with friends/ family. I would consider myself clean, tidy &amp; respectful of others space and belongings. I am in a relationship, and would like if my partner is aloud over to visit, I understand if that would add to cost. I hope to be able to connect with you soon and talk more‚ú®\n               \n                                   ü§ç",

I‚Äôm definitely looking for a place close into town. Flexible with the move-in date :)\nA bit about me:\nI study Outdoor Leadership at TAFE. This makes my weeks full of either class days, or days out in the field having fun hiking, canoeing or mountain biking. Later in the week you‚Äôll find me at work, fuelling my caffeine addiction as a barista. I can be a pretty busy bee, but I love to have some down time when I get the chance. This can look like time spent playing some guitar (acoustic so don‚Äôt worry about me being loud), reading, watching some movies, cooking up a good feast. \nI would really love to move into a place that I could call home, not just a place to sleep, and preferably with people my age. I really look forward to building some awesome relationships with some funky peeps.\nFeel free to send me a message if you‚Äôve got any questions or want to chat more.\nThanks everyone.",

I‚Äôm open minded and outgoing.\n\nIn my free time I love to go camping with my friends, I am an avid fisherman, and I ride motocross. My parents live in Coolum Beach but they also have a large farm in the hinterland and I spend a lot of weekends there riding motocross (we have our own track) and helping my dad and grandpa with general farm duties. I love the peace and tranquil nature of being out there, but equally love being on the coast to go fishing, camping, swimming, going out for dinner etc.\n\nI have very stable full time  employment and I have been trained by my parents to be clean and tidy and respectful. I currently live in their downstairs granny flat, which is self-contained, and I am expected to keep it to a proper rental standard. I hope that I can be given a chance to prove myself as a respectable tenant, as this is my first time moving out of home, so I don't have available the references and or rental history etc.\n \nI am looking for somewhere to stay for around 6-12 months and or longer if it suits‚Ä¶ \n\nThankyou.",

    "description": "And just like that Grommie and I are on the hunt for a new place to call home! \n\nThe lease on our house is ending in November but can be a little bit flexible with a move in date. Ideally looking for something close to the beach, a decent size room with natural light, a built in and a good size yard for the pup! I would prefer to live with just one other who‚Äôs is close in age but open to two if the vibe was right :) Home is like a little sanctuary so looking for somewhere that‚Äôs peaceful, light filled and feels good to be in.\n\nEasy going person, love the ocean and surfing. Love to cook when i have time, and love having cook ups and drinks with the housemates every so often. I‚Äôm in my smutty fantasy book reading era.\n\nI don‚Äôt mind having a have a beer on the weekend when Im not working but not a big partier and not looking for a party house or a place that does kick ons! \n\nI work as a nurse doing cosmetic injectables a couple days a week and do shift at the hospital as well.\n\nI also have a 6yr old Kelpie x Staffy named Grommie! He is the sweetest happiest boy and everyone that meets him just loves him. He is an indoor outdoor dog and is known to come cuddle on the lounge (if it‚Äôs allowed) and sleeps in my room, so above all else looking for a place that he can still do that. He gets along great with other dogs as long as they‚Äôve been introduced properly and I think he would prefer to have a doggy playmate!\n\nLived in plenty of shares houses before, I clean up after myself and Grom. Let me know if you might have something suitable. Places I‚Äôm looking are Merewether and surrounds, Dudley, Redhead, Whitebridge or Charlestown on the coastal side :)\n\nCheers",

I love being outdoors as much as possible whether running, bush walking, camping or beach. \nI'm a social being so often out and about though I do need down time. I‚Äôm very partial to a mid-week yarn and drink or dinner but I respect others space and privacy. I like to keep my own and communal space clean and tidy.\nI enjoy coffee (addiction, help), dogs (I have a kelpie cross who lives with my folks, hopefully she can visit wherever I land), cooking, travelling (I want to see more of Australia!), skiing, exploring markets, pickling and fermenting (recently nailed sauerkraut) and so on. \nI moved home from London late last year and I‚Äôm now transitioning to Newcastle from Sydney. So I‚Äôm looking for a place to call home with friendly like-minded people.\nI‚Äôd love to find somewhere near the beach (Cooks Hill, Bar Beach, The Junction, Mereweather etc.) with one or two other people. Flexible move in date, ideally sometime in November. I‚Äôm looking for somewhere long term but would be open to sublet for a few months. ",

I appreciate the character and warmth of classic homes and am hoping to find a space that feels both charming and comfortable.\n\nI work in tech and have a hybrid work setup, which means I split my time between working from home and the office. My job also involves regular travel, so I‚Äôll be in and out quite a bit. I‚Äôm flexible with the move-in date, aiming for sometime between late November and December.\n\nI‚Äôm easygoing, respectful of shared spaces, and enjoy keeping a friendly, relaxed home environment. Outside of work, I enjoy exploring the city, trying new cafes and restaurants, and staying active. Looking forward to meeting potential new housemates who appreciate a laid-back and tidy living space!\n\nI‚Äôm on the far right in my photo and my insta is @bfarrug ",

    "description": "Hi,\n\nI'm Dongho, currently living in Labrador. I'm originally from Korea and was born in 1998. I've been studying nursing . \n\nI don't smoke, use drugs, or drink alcohol. I guarantee that I will treat your home with the same respect as I do my own back home. Since moving to Australia in 2022, I've had no issues with roommates or landlords.\n\nI plan to stay for at least a year as I continue my studies at the university. I'm planning to move on as soon as possible.\n\nI'm a respectful and considerate person, which is customary in my culture. I'm also good at cleaning up after myself, whether it's after a shower or when using shared spaces like the kitchen.\n\nAdditionally, I can provide you with my criminal record, student ID, visa conditions, passport, residence history, university enrollment, and any other paperwork.\nThanks !",

Would love to eventually make a garden and grow my own veggies. I love love animals (don‚Äôt have any) but if the place has any pets it‚Äôs a major plus for me.\n\nI study online part time as well in psychology as I‚Äôm trying to get more into art therapy :) hoping to use my creativity and psychology together to form unique sessions with people.\nI love a peaceful home and I don‚Äôt drink at all but don‚Äôt mind if other people do, just not super into partying but if I do go out I‚Äôm very happy to leave the party at the party and not bring it home with me. Very much like to keep my space calm.\nMy website¬†Bree brooks dot com \nIg breebrookz\n\nHope to hear from you!",

I am understanding of personal space and always fair when it comes to household rules and communication.\n\nMy daschunds name is Charlie and she is quite the good girl! She is socialised and she just loves walking playing and sleeping. I am a responsible pet parent and do what is needed to tire her out and keep her happy.\n\nI feel it is important that I mention this upfront as I understand not everyone is 100% accepting of pets! however Charlie would make a great companion to another small easygoing pet.\n\n\nSide notes:\n\nI do have a partner that lives 1.5 hrs away, so I usually would be out with charlie visiting him on weekends. If there was a chance he could visit me every now and again that would be cool also.\n\nLooking to rent for 12 months or long term if it's suitable- if that helps you at all with future planning.\n\nIt does take me a little while to open up to new people üò∂ so I probably wont be the life of the party but I am always down for for a walk/coffee/explore and a glass of wine. I enjoy equal amounts of quiet time for reading or life admin etc.\n\nI'm really pretty chill and happy to make this work around you if you're willing to have someone bobbing around your place. ",

We‚Äôve been living with a lovely lady while working at a winery in Victoria and we‚Äôre now moving to the Gold Coast.\n\nWe like go to the beach, for a hike and the gym. I like to cook and I‚Äôd be happy to share a meal now and then but we‚Äôre definitely not pushy people and fully respect your privacy.\n\nWe have lived in shared spaces many times, so it comes very natural to us.

I have lived in rentals for the majority of my life so have a good foundation and understanding of my responsibilities as a tenant. \n\nI am currently studying Computer Science part-time, and also work a customer service x retail job part-time. I admire and have a passion for the arts. In my spare time I typically nap, watch YouTube, Netflix, TikTok, or Spiral. I like to cook as well, and will often be happy to cook for multiple people. \n\nI also have a cat! Her name is Scarlett, she's a massive cuddler and I'm pretty sure she's gay.  Scarlett is super adorable, I don't think she has a brain in her head, and she may be slightly vision impaired (she is a little imbred). She also has no teeth!!! (except for a couple ones at the front). \n\nI am introverted and like having time to myself to wind down, however, if something comes up that I am particularly interested in (depending on my mood) I won't be afraid to share. I will be 100% honest, while I appreciate a clean and tidy place I do have ADHD so can struggle to consistently maintain upkeep. Typically I will need expectations clearly laid out, time frames also help to ensure upkeep. If something needs to be done let me know and I will be happy to fix it up. \n\nI am hoping to find a roommate who is empathetic and aligns with me politically (lefty). Also AC!! I have fairly significant sensory processing issues, especially around the heat. While I understand that I may not be able to find a place within my price range with AC in the bedroom I will require AC somewhere in the house especially with summer coming up. \n\nIf you feel you are interested in learning more please don't hesitate to give me a shout!",

I‚Äôd like to move in as soon as possible and am ideally looking to sign a 12-month lease, though I‚Äôm open to other options.\n\nI‚Äôm an animal lover and would enjoy getting to know any pets you might have. I also have a passion for gardening, especially growing tomatoes, which seem to thrive whenever I plant them. While I‚Äôm usually quite busy with various commitments, I also value relaxing and hanging out at home.",

    "description": "Hi there, potential housemates and homeowners! I'm Rein ‚Äì yep, just like the deer, minus the sleigh and red suit. I‚Äôm a non-smoker, non-drinker, no kids or pets, just good vibes and a knack for keeping things chill. I recently migrated south from Brisbane to Sydney and am now on a quest to find a home that I can fill with good energy and zero drama.\n\nBy day, I‚Äôm a corporate wizard in the Learning &amp; Development space, teaching people things they never knew they needed to know. After hours? I swap the boardroom for the mosh pit! I film concerts for some of the biggest names in music‚ÄîMatchbox Twenty, Goo Goo Dolls, Incubus, Spiderbait, Airbourne, Steel Panther and more. If you've ever wanted to live with someone who works with rockstars but is still humble enough to stack the dishwasher properly, I'm your guy.\n\nHome is my sanctuary, my chill zone. So, while I‚Äôm out there hustling and making things happen in the corporate world or rocking out at gigs, that when I am home, I like to keep things zen. No wild parties here (unless you count my 3D printer quietly humming in the background while I create something innovative and cool). I‚Äôm also a big fan of clean spaces, because who doesn‚Äôt like to come home to a place that actually feels like home?\n\nI‚Äôm financially secure, always pay rent and bills in advance (because adulting is easier when you‚Äôre ahead of the game), and I‚Äôve been renting all my life. So, If you're looking for a respectful, fun, and hard-working housemate who also has a killer playlist (and maybe free concert tickets from time to time), and who loves to bake, (cakes are my jam, literally!) then I think we‚Äôll get along just fine!",

Regarding cleanliness and order, I am super organized and clean, and I am always willing to collaborate with household tasks to keep our space in the best condition.\n\nFinancially, you can rest assured, since I always fulfill my responsibilities and pay on time.\n\nI look forward to the opportunity to meet and explore the possibility of sharing this new chapter of life together!\n\nThank you for considering me as your next roommate!\n\nKind regards,",

I love getting out for morning walks, getting a coffee and spending time in cafes. I feel that it is really important to have alone time to rejuvenate, as well as having social time so I am very respectful of space and love living in a clean, tidy atmosphere. I like to relax by going to yoga and doing wholesome activities as a balance to work / social life. \n\nI'm really easy going and would love to become a friend, not just a flatmate :)\n\nWhen I first arrive in Sydney I will be looking for a short term rental as I have holiday plans but then I will be on the search for something more permanent!",

I love gf baking and trying new healthy recipes and I'm always down to share food but also don't think this is a must.\nMy boyfriend will be visiting from time to time and staying for a couple weeks throughout the year. He is clean and respectful and loves beach volley.",

    "description": "Hi there!\n\nI‚Äôm Lauren! My current house lease in Kirra is ending 24 November, and I‚Äôm looking to move to somewhere in burleigh!! Ideally closest to the beach as possible :P\n\nA little about me, I‚Äôm 25, and a full time international student at Griffith uni getting my Masters in Social Work, working part time at a sushi restaurant in cooly. I‚Äôm just about to finish my first year of the masters and have another year and half to go!\n\nI‚Äôve already lived in Oz 2 years however, originally came here as an international surf instructor!\n\nI love to surf, and when I‚Äôm not surfing I‚Äôm also taking voice lessons in jazz at a studio in Burleigh, hanging with my mates getting a few cheeky drinks or food, painting, doing some other creative shit, or probably laughing at memes on my phone.\n\nI‚Äôd like to be a school social worker when I graduate, and am also forging a part time gig in the performing arts. :)\n\nLooking for something fun and chill, but  conscientious of others, ideally with some like-minded gals around the same age! Making sure everyone pitches in for chores. Lots of leafy plants, art on the walls, and a communal record player is the vibe. üåøüé∂üß° If that is also your vibe üëå\n\nAlso a plus is if you have a dog/cat that I get benefit from existing in the house with, but without being the primary caretaker üòù but obviously not a necessity‚Ä¶\n\nMove-in date ideally between 16-24 Nov however could be flexible\n\nHappy to provide any Aussie housemate and work references if you‚Äôd like ü´∂\n\nüå∏üå∏üå∏\nx Loz\n",

I'm a Portuguese solo traveller. \nBeen in Australia for almost 5 years now, travelled and worked across most states, and lived with a lot of different nationalities.\n\nI am looking for a quiet house, tidy and clean where I can chill. I'm social and enjoy sharing a drink every now and then, but home is where i charge my batteries so I'm usually just chillin on my own.\n\nI'm an early riser and usually in bed early, so being in a house where someone's cooking dinner at 10pm wouldn't really be the best fit.\nI'm always super considerate about my mates so appreciate when they act the same way towards me.\n\nI do like to have occasionally a friend over for a chat, share a meal, but definitely not the type of person that will have gatherings all the time, so wouldn't like to end up in a house that busy.\n\nI love the beach, I love food, and enjoy surfing. I like going out for that sunset beer, or a homemade cheese and wine, but also, I love doing lots of nothing! I'm pescatarian, and really don't mind about anyone else's dietary as long as you clean after yourself that's all I care.\n\nThis is me folks! I hope to find a suitable house.

    "description": "Hi üëãüèº my name is Sammy.\n\nI run my own business in Product Management Consultancy in the tech space and I do this from home, cafes, libraries and occasionally a co-working space. So I am looking for a place where taking the odd zoom call isn't a problem. I don't necessarily need an office or massive room and am comfortable working from the loungeroom and in open spaces.\n\nI like to be social with my housemates, building a great relationship together but like everyone I also like my downtime for rest.\n\nLove being by the beach and I believe our environment heavily impacts our well-being. Living somewhere beautiful with cheery people is my jam.\n\nDuring the week I go for lots of walks, the gym, yoga and recovery places like saunas etc. on the weekends I'll do anything to get outside, surfing, camping, the rail trail, time on the water is my happy place.\n\nI have started seeing someone, he occasionally spends a night at my place but as he owns his own home I do tend to spend more nights there with him.\n\nI've been share housing for forever so I'm a pretty well trained, easy going housemate. I tend to take on the habits of my housemates, so if you like it sparkling clean I'll try my best. If you're more relaxed I'll also be that way!",

When I'm off work I am keeping an active outdoor lifestyle and I also like to travel a lot so I'm not around much. I am clean, tidy and respectful. Prefer to move in with someone that owns their own home as I am keen to stick around for a while as well as having secure parking for my car whilst I'm away at work, but they arent deal breakers. \n\nI am looking for Scarborough/surrounding areas or North Freo/surrounding areas. Please don't send me messages if you are not close to these areas. \n\nPlease reach out if you have something that might suit.\n\nThanks\nScottee",

I have a second job at an arts centre (because, the economy). I am a performer as well, specifically burlesque and cabaret, but I also do some directing too. \n\nI am super passionate about movement (pilates, yoga), self-development, creative expression, and I love being around people who challenge my worldview and inspire me to grow. I really enjoy connecting with new people and I am often out seeing friends/my partner, going to classes, or having a boogie, but I would also love a home where I can feel comfortable unwinding, creating, and relaxing in. \n\nAll that said, I am big on communication and enjoy a clean, communal environment, and I would enjoy a genuine friendship with the people I live with. Let me know if this is something you resonate with or if you have any questions. \n\nI am keen to meet and learn more about you too! (Hopefully over a soy iced latte or our favourite music.)\n\n",

I am looking for a place where I can build a friendship with the females / males in the house with clear communication making it a healthy happy house for us all.

I enjoy kitchen fun and banter, or getting takeaway together and binging on a show.\nI am also LGBTQ+ friendly and open.\nI am a bit of a running/strava nerd and will sign up to every marathon, half or City2Surf under the sun - and an avid parkrunner.\nI used to be a graphic designer so am interested in art, galleries and creative pursuits.\nI also apreaciate a hiking, camping or beach trip, or conversely lovely going to gigs.\nMore than happy to look after any pets when you're not around.\nI'm pretty flexible with move-in date but do need to give my current housemates 2-3 weeks' notice.\nIf I sound like someone you might be interested in living with, let's tee up a house inspection üôÇ\nThanks, Nils",

We‚Äôre hoping to find a granny flat/studio/tiny home/space (ideally two rooms) in a sharehouse that‚Äôs okay with couples ‚Äî even perhaps a setup in a homestay or on-the-land kind of situation. Chris is a budding permaculturalist and wants somewhere he can plant all kinds of flora and retrofit some systems; I simply adore nature and want to be somewhere I can wander around forests, mountains, or water. I'm a support worker/writer/photographer who does some work from home, some out in the community.\n\nWe‚Äôre both pretty spiritual, earthy, affable people who love our peace and quiet and early nights ‚Äî though we‚Äôll hit up the odd gig or festival or cultural event that catches our interest, not to mention share in deep and engaging conversations about our wonderful, quirky world (sociable introverts, you could call us). We would be looking to move ideally somewhere in the mid-range of SC (Buderim, Palmwoods, Yandina etc., inland or coastal; would consider as far up as Doonan or Eumundi or down towards Caloundra/Currimundi) as soon as possible, though we'll need to give our current landlords at least two weeks' notice to move. Our budget is somewhere between the $250-450 mark, depending on the space; we‚Äôre open to discussion should we stumble on our dream place.\n\nCurious to see what options are out there. We‚Äôre really excited for a change of pace and scenery, and the prospect of new communities and living more in flow with nature. Let us know if you have any questions, and maybe have the right abode for us! Much gratitude ‚ú®üå±",
