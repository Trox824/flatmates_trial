After almost a year in Sydney, I'm excited to make Canberra my new home, where I work full-time as a Cybersecurity professional (Risk and Compliance) at a Canberra-based NGO and am also pursuing a Master’s in Cybersecurity by research. I’ve been renting for over 10 years, so I understand and respect the sharing culture well. \n\nOutside of work, I’m passionate about cooking – happy to whip up a meal for a few people and enjoy sharing it too. I also love watching legal, political, and crime dramas, exploring new places, and spending time in nature. I’ve travelled over 17 countries and backpacked through thus am comfortable with people from diverse backgrounds. I don’t smoke (though I’m fine with those who do) and am a social drinker, usually enjoying a beer at the pub on Thursdays and Fridays after work and always up for a drink with flatmates. \n\nI’m looking for a household where privacy matters, but it also feels like home rather than living with strangers. Feel free to check out my Instagram to get to know me a bit more. Looking forward to meeting like-minded people to share a comfortable, friendly space with!	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 05:49:58.461	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 05:49:58.461	0

So, I left Hobart in last year August and came back here few months ago again after travelling for 5 months in the globe. \n\nSince then, I found a new job and have been settling down. At the moment, I’m staying and looking after my friend’s house on Huon Rd in South Hobart for short-term while he is away for a few months.

My shift starts in the early morning and finish in the afternoon. \n\nIn my free time, I enjoy surfing, bushwalking, rock climbing (mostly outdoor sport climbing), power lifting and cooking (especially fermenting stuff). As I'm a very outdoorsy person, I spent my free time outside of home a lot, but I always try to make balance between outdoor life and indoor (movie, reading, etc.) as well. \n\nI'm a social drinker and I’m a non-smoker. And easy going, very open for learning new things. \n\nI am communal minded person, but of course I do know how to respect personal space and time, too.\n\nI've rented house and sublet rooms for last 5 years. So, I can say I know how to look after the property and maintain it in good shape.\n\nI'm looking forward to living with minded person and make house filled with good vibe. 	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 05:35:39.659	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 05:35:39.659	0

I’m looking for a new furnished/semi-furnished ensuite room to move near Pyrmont, Ultimo, Sydney CBD, Darling Harbour, Haymarket, Surry Hills, Waterloo or Parramatta.\n\nI usually have a busy schedule during weekdays, working in an IT/Consulting firm in Barangaroo and I like to rest and refresh during weekends.

I recently came back from overseas and searching for my new place. \n\nI’m clean and organised, usually in my own space and room. I cook only few days in a week and like to do some interior decoration. I work during the week and have my own business projects, so that keeps me busy. Weekends I run my errands, clean the house and socialise with friends and family. Happy to have a drink or dinner together when free. I'm easy-going with flatmates and would prefer someone very clean, friendly, organised and shares a roster to maintain the home.\n\nKeen to have a chat if you have any suitable options for 1 bed or 2 bed units.

F4189932	Ann	$380/week•35 year old woman	\N	…..UPDATED….. \nHi, I’m from England but have spent a couple of years in Aus before, I’ve also lived abroad in several other countries, and the last 7 years I have been in Scotland. \n\nI currently have a temporary room in a flat-share, they are totally flexible as to how long I stay, so my move-in date could be pretty much anytime in November, or beginning of December. \n\nIdeally I’d like to be within a 35minute WALK to Surfers North (my work), or within a 15 minute walk to a tram stop. I don’t have a car so anywhere too far away probably wouldn’t be suitable. My own bathroom would be great, but not essential. Initially I’m looking for a 6 month commitment (if it’s a less that could also be fine), although I will probably stay on the Gold Coast for a year, so potentially could extend in the future.\n\nI work full-time in hospitality, don’t worry though - if I get in late after work I’ll generally be heading straight to bed, quietly!\n\nI’ve traveled a lot so get on with most nationalities, and am social but also very respectful of personal space - I’ve lived in flat-shares a lot in the past. Prefer somewhere clean, with a mix of guys/ girls, but can be flexible on this.\n	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 05:38:23.223	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 05:38:23.223	0

I'm open-minded and respectful, but consistent cleanliness and personal hygiene is a must :)\n\nWhen I can make time, I love doing short multi-day hikes (I miss my hometown in the Blue Mountains), or surfing and diving when I'm nearer to the coast. \n\nIdeally I'm looking for an unfurnished room as I've got my own bedroom furniture, and a few other items. I've got a decent fridge (happy to keep in storage or bring to the house), but some secure garage storage would be really great for climbing and dive gear. 	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 05:38:52	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 05:38:52	0

F3810271	Brock	$350/week•32 year old man	\N	Hi there! I'm a 32-year-old guy who is a ray of sunshine and enjoys being outside more than in.\n\nWhen I'm not busy with work, you can often find me engrossed in a good book. Reading is my escape, my way of exploring different worlds and expanding my horizons. It's a peaceful and calming activity that I can't get enough of.\n\nBut don't mistake me for a complete homebody! I also enjoy taking long walks, especially when the weather is nice. There's something about being outside, surrounded by nature, that rejuvenates my soul. And speaking of nature, the beach is my happy place. The sound of crashing waves, the feel of sand between my toes, and the warmth of the sun on my skin—it's pure bliss.\n\nTo stay fit and healthy, I hit the gym often. Sweating it out and pushing my limits not only keeps me physical besides being on my feet at work but also helps clear my mind. It's a great way to release any stress or tension that may have built up during the day. To stay mentally healthy I enjoy meditation, journalling and a good stretch 😌 \n\nAs for my ideal living environment, I strive for a clean and organized space. A clutter-free home allows me to think clearly and find peace in my surroundings. But that doesn't mean it has to be boring! I love adding fun and vibrant touches to create an ambiance that reflects my vibrant personality. But I'm not OCD about it I like a home that feels lived in, not a display home.\n\nSunlight is essential to me. I crave the warmth and natural light that floods through my windows, creating a bright and inviting atmosphere. It lifts my spirits and energizes me, making me feel more alive.\n\nI don't own any pets or have kids, but I'm open to living with someone who does, as long as they are well-behaved and respectful of our shared space.\n\nIf I sound like someone you'd like to live with hit me up 😁	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 05:37:39.748	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 05:37:39.748	0

F4160096	Charlie	$350/week•23 year old non-binary	\N	Hi! My name is Charlie, I am 23 years old – I go by them/them pronouns, and I am queer. I am a quite friendly, easy-going and chill person who enjoys a chat whilst also valuing privacy and space to unwind after a long day. \n\nI hold a bachelor’s degree in architecture, so I am actively looking for employment. Whilst I wait - I am currently studying my Master of Architecture at UQ and applying for Christmas casual / casual hospo retail roles.\n\nI don’t smoke, not a massive drinker but enjoy being social and having the occasional beer. As a housemate, I am clean and tidy as I struggle to focus when in a messy space and respectful of others wishes to have a clean space. Also, I have shared house before and understand the general requirements to keep a household afloat.\n\nWhen I’m not in the studio working on my architectural studies, I enjoy going out for  coffee, attending markets, going to gigs and listening to music (with headphones of course). I generally like to do my own thing in a quiet manner, but I would be more than happy to share meals and hang out with other housemates.\n\nFinancially speaking, I receive regular Centrelink payment to go toward rent and bills as well as consistent support from my parents. My rental history also shows that I consistently pay rent on time as well.\n\nI really want to create a beautiful and relaxing space in which I can feel safe and rest with likeminded friendly people.\n	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 05:36:31.347	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 05:36:31.347	0

Lucie is a veterinary nurse, and I am a heavy equipment mechanic doing FIFO. \n\nAs part of the next stage of our plan, we are both working full time in our jobs to accrue hours and experience in the hopes of passing a government skills assessment.\nWe are very clean, tidy and respectful people with references from previous landlords that will prove this. Being busy most of time with work doesn't leave space for much else but we both enjoy getting to the gym, the beach, exploring and scuba diving \n\nWe are looking for a place that we and any housemates can take pride in and look forward to coming to at the end of each day/ swing. It is important to us that the place is clean and that house duties are equally shared and actually get done. \n\nWe thank you for taking the time to consider us. 	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 05:36:21.047	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 05:36:21.047	0

I have a passion for reading and listening to audiobooks, and I love diving into my own art and media projects. Being a child at heart, I enjoy watching Disney and Studio Ghibli movies, along with anything intriguing on Netflix.\n\nIn my downtime, I focus on self-care and appreciate a good balance between socializing and having some quiet time. Friends describe me as friendly, easygoing, and respectful of others' space and privacy. I'm hoping to find flatmates who are considerate, tidy, and enjoy a mix of deep discussions and casual chats.\n\nIf you think we'd get along well, feel free to reach out.

F3730691	Chris	$400/week•36 year old man	\N	Hey lovely people, we're looking for either:\n\n1) A team-up (preferred) - Looking for an amazing person or two to get a new lease together. I have a whole house full of furniture and would love to co-create a harmonious space; Calling in those communal vibes where we all feel at home, not just squatting in a room in someone else's house. \n\n2) A long-term room in a share house, must be pet friendly and with a bit of storage room. Please, if its not pet friendly, I'm not interested. \n\n---\n\nMyself and my pup Jed (8yo Kelpie x Border Collie) have had to move from our last home due to water leaks and mould, and are now calling in our new home.\n\nI work for council with the mobile library; love the outdoors and keeping active, surfing, yoga; latin dancing; exploring mindfullness, self development and spirituality. I give the best hugs and always down for deep chats over tea, communal dinners etc. I'm easy going, down to earth, handy, clean but not meticulous, rarely drink and don't smoke. I value gentleness, healthy living, good communication, and am looking to create a calm and relaxing space to come home to. \n\nJed is a cuddle bug who loves everyone and everything. He's fully house trained, doesn't bark or shed, but has no idea of personal space. He'll quite happily sleep on the couch all day if noone's around, and now only has three legs. Unfortunately we recently lost my other dog, so we're open to living with someone who also has a well behaved dog as I'm sure he'd love another mate. \n\nI'm ideally looking around north Byron shire: Ocean Shores (preferred), Sth Golden, Bruns, The Pocket, Mullum, Myocum, Coorabell, Suffolk & Lennox. I have solid rental history and stable employment. \n\nReally hoping to get somewhere quiet as I am sensitive to mechanical noise (i.e. not on a busy road, a party house or a tv shrine blaring) and ideally a bit of storage room as I do have a lot of tools (that I'm hoping to downsize). Roomy, mould free, lots of light, a bonus would be with a bit of a view. Non-smokers only please, and no drug users. \n\nFeel free to reach out if you think we'd be a good fit ✨️\n\n	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 05:38:28.482	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 05:38:28.482	0

F4185859	Steven AKA Rosey	$250/week•57 year old man	\N	I pride myself at looking after the house that I live in, I enjoy my own space and I enjoy time with the people i live (flatmates or there friends/families) I do respect everyone's space and choices in life as not all people are the same. I love doing my own cooking even though it's not the gourmet style but it feeds me + love eating out at nice places, I enjoy reading a good books and the internet is a must because I run a great eBay store which I sell AFL Trading Cards through which keeps me quite busy all year round. I was born at Semaphore & have lived in the Port Adelaide area all my life and am proud to have got my Life Membership at the old Port Adelaide Football Club Magpies Pre Power. But the last 7 years I have lived in New Zealand that's where I am at the moment but I'm looking to come back home as soon as possible but can't until I organise a place to live. I miss my family i have 2 kids into their early 20s and my Mum and Dad they all live in the Port area it would be great to just be able to see them regularly love ❤️ them so much & miss them just as much if not more. I'm not sure what else to write sorry the main thing is I respect as everything that comes with renting a house/flat with others or maybe boarding with a family. If you would like to now anymore you can always contact me though here ask away I'm an open book will tell you all and if you like i can call you from NZ. Thanks very much! Cheers all from Steven aka as Rosey to my friends due to my last name.	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 05:39:05.633	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 05:39:05.633	0

F3911569	Donna Kaiser	$500/week•50 year old woman	\N	I am a healthy, happy 50 (approx) year-old woman who enjoys living in a quiet, peaceful and comfortable environment, ideally with some garden aspect, outdoor area or close to a beach or river.  I am relocating to Byron Bay from Noosa late Oct/early November to commence a new full time role in the beauty/wellness industry.  I'm looking for a nice living environment either as a share (ideally 1-2 people maximum) or a self-contained studio/apartment to settle into.  I am open to the length of stay - short term can work initially however longer term for the right place is also perfect. \nOriginally from N.Z.,  North Island initially, then the South, I have two grown up young adults; one who lives in Brisbane, the other still in N.Z.  I love the outdoors, nature captivates me and I enjoy (and need) to spend endless hours on the beach whenever I can. I love mountains, lakes and rivers and long walks or quiet time to explore all that the outdoor environment offers.  I also enjoy music, reading,  yoga, having quiet time at home and enjoy social connections and conversation.  I eat healthily, love to cook and share a meal or glass of wine when relaxing or if appropriate. When it comes to my home, a healthy living environment and cleanliness is essential and if living or sharing with others, I always strive to maintain a harmonious and happy atmosphere. Good energy, honesty and respect are key elements in creating the perfect living space for me.  I own my own home in NZ (now rented out) and have been an Airbnb and homestay host for many years so are super comfortable with having others around and sharing communal spaces.  	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 05:51:32.061	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 05:51:32.061	0

F4196820	Tom	$450/week•29 year old man	\N	Hey there!\n\nI'm Tom. 29 year old, working full time as a Physiotherapist down at Robina Hospital. I've been up on the Gold Coast since March after moving from Victoria and I love it here!\n\nI'm currently renting a granny flat in Highland Park, moving out in mid-late November (old occupant is in the main house and is moving back in once the landlord moves back home). Hoping to find a similar setup (flat, unit, studio) for under $500 once bills are accounted for. Also happy to look at house sharing with a max of one other person, okay with up to $350 for this. Bonus if you have a furry friend. Would prefer no further north than Molendinar or south than Burleigh (trying to minimise time on the M1 haha).\n\nWhen I'm not working, I like to keep active going to the gym, beach walks or hiking. Otherwise I tend to chill at home or head up to Brisbane to see friends. Love a good bakery/cafe brunch and don't mind a cheeky drink here and there. Tend to keep to myself but always up for hanging out if the vibe is right. I've lived in a few share houses so know how to clean up after myself. Only thing I'm firm on is internet. I like to stream stuff and video call friends/family, so nice to not have things buffer or drop out.\n\nIf I sound like a good fit for whatever you are offering let me know. :)\n\n\n\n\n\n	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 05:40:42.287	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 05:40:42.287	0

Afterwards I'll be backpacking around Australia, New Zealand, and Asia during the summer holidays!\n\nI already miss the dog back home so if you've got a pet that's a bonus 😄\n\nThanks for reading.

Around  $400pw (preferably less of course) is what I would like to find.\n\nThanks for reading and reach out anytime!	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 05:40:42.287	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 05:40:42.287	0

F3708023	Gabrielle	$350/week•56 year old woman	\N	Hi. My name is Gabby, short for Gabrielle. I’m a recently retired primary school teacher looking for a nice place to live with nice people. I’ve lived in Perth all my life. I have a beautiful little dog named Lilly, a Maltese Shih Tzu who is a bundle of love and fun. I enjoy quiet times at home, catching up with friends and family, watching movies, and also watching the motorbike racing on TV. I am into reading and music, too. I occasionally go to a pub to see a live band, to have a meal & a drink, or any combination of these. Walking my dog is something else that I enjoy very much &, of course, getting outdoors into nature which seems to feed my soul. I am reliable, mature, responsible and considerate of other people’s needs. I look forward to meeting you. \nThank you. 	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 05:53:16.316	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 05:53:16.316	0

F1250242	Brose	$400/week•37 year old man	\N	Hi there! I’ve been back in Perth for the last 12 months after spending over 7 years in Melbourne and North America. Since returning, I’ve been renting a granny flat in White Gum Valley which has been great for my circumstances. However, the property is now being put on the market, so I’m keen to find a new place very soon. \n\nI had a look at some 1-bedroom apartments for rent and the general vibe is there few and far between, way overpriced, run-down, and lines of people inspecting the property which is quite deflating. I have been contemplating purchasing however feel now is not the greatest time with current market conditions. So, that said, if you’re in a similar position I’d love to find a proper house, existing or team-up, with a like-minded person (or max 2) around a similar age (say 32-45).\n\nFor lifestyle and work reasons I’m looking to find a place in Subiaco, East Fremantle, White Gum Valley, or close by suburbs. I’m looking for a reasonably modern and spacious place where we aren’t living on top of each other. Ideally, it would have multiple living areas and an outdoor space, something I really miss at my current place. If you have a dog that is awesome and happy to help out with that, but by no means a deal breaker. I’m willing to pay up to $450 per week plus bills for the right home.\n\nBriefly about me: I work full-time in property and run a few small businesses on the side, which keeps me quite busy. I currently work a mix of WFH and at a shared office in Nedlands, where I have 24/7 access. I lead an active lifestyle, playing tennis 2-3 times a week (when I'm not injured!), hitting the gym, enjoying the sauna/beach regularly, and catching up with friends. I’m fortunate to have a family holiday home in Margaret River, which I like to escape too whenever possible. I’m fairly recently single, no kids, and not really looking to date right now although when I do you can trust I’m super respectful in that regard.\n\nIf you’re looking for something similar, please get in touch. Cheers!\n	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 05:52:05.301	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 05:52:05.301	0

F1534290	Josh	$250/week•35 year old man	\N	Hi Everyone\n\nI'm looking for a room at a property that allows and is suitable for a dog.  He is very quite, relaxed, happy and friendly.  As for me, I'm also quiet, clean and keep myself busy most of the time.  Either at work, spending time with the dog out and about keeping social and active.  I fill the rest of my time training at gym or boxing, playing sports or doing something active and fun or just at the beach or a cafe.  When I'm home I'm usually trying to cook something nutritious (tasty is a bonus), relaxing, reading or staying on top of all the pesky domestic side of life and home.\n\nThe dog is very chilled, smart, funny and gentle along with becoming a free security system.  He doesn't need alot of space as he is always close by me just laying around resting until its time to go somewhere again.  He generally waits until going for a walk to do his toilet business as opposed to in his own back yard.\n\nI have done the Share house living lifestyle for many years now, having experienced and getting along with a wide variety of people of all cultures and lifestyles. I am very tolerant, patient and understanding of how people live differently and I'm very laid back and get along casually with mostly anybody.   Happy to find myself in either short or long term arrangement as I like the change of scenery when necessary but also enjoy to nestle in and make a place a home.  Whether its a lovely friendly vibe or people just keep to themselves, I'm easy.  Can merrily keep to myself and respect others space or set ways of living or embrace a communal environment.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read my profile, if you think I could be your next fantastic housemate then i hope to hear from you! \n\nCheers\nJosh	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 05:42:33.579	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 05:42:33.579	0

I would prefer housemates that like some social interaction as opposed to completely doing their own thing but of course we all need some alone time.\n\nBooking a three month stay initially would be perfect for me, but I would be open to extending it if everything went well during that time.\n\nPlease feel free to reach out with any other questions you might have or if you have somewhere you think might suit!\n	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 05:52:31.306	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 05:52:31.306	0

I graduated a couple of years ago and have been working in London since. I'm really excited to move and would love to be part of a house-share. I'm very social and enjoy coffees, drinks with friends and sports and spend a lot of my weekends playing comp. tennis, running and doing cross-fit.

I'd ideally love to live in a social suburb, in a nice flat with space for a desk and amenities and have heard great things about Bondi, Bondi Junction, Bellevue Hill, Coogee, Waverley and Clovelly but also open to others! If you have any accommodation that sounds like a good fit or are keen to team up please feel free to get in touch!	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 05:42:33.579	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 05:42:33.579	0

I am looking for somewhere to call home for at least 6 months while I do my best to get a house to call my own. \nI am a soft kiwi , in Brisbane for 4 years, so need some form of AC in my room, literally cannot sleep without it in summer is so it is a deal breaker. 	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 05:43:26.496	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 05:43:26.496	0
F4066220	Liam Linford and Nina	$400/week•24-30 year old man and woman	\N	Hello/Hallo! We are Liam (UK - 30) & Nina (Germany - 24), a European couple who have just left the sunny QLD coast after travelling and working in Australia for the last 6 months. We are currently having a little holiday from the holiday in the significantly cheaper confines of Asia and will return to Perth at the end of October. As such we are looking to find a place to live for November for 6–12 months or more. Preferably our own place but we dont mind sharing (especially if you have pets!). We would love to be close to the beach so we can enjoy running, swimming and chilling in the hammock most days, but close to public transport links is also fine. We enjoy spending our free time hiking, biking, kayaking, camping, reading, playing games and watching movies. We're always up for cooking together and having a few drinks but we're not big party people and prefer a quiet night in nowadays. We met in Canada so we have lots of experience living in shared housing situations and know how to be clean, tidy and respectful housemates. We also love all kinds of animals and would love to find some like–minded people we can hang out with :D	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 05:53:45.297	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 05:53:45.297	0

F3701270	Naz	$250/week•38 year old woman	\N	I'm Nazanin, but you can call me Naz. I work as a drafter for a medical device company and work from home, where I have my own desk and chair. In my free time, I enjoy both spending time outdoors and going to the gym, as well as staying in to cook or work on my laptop. On weekends, I mostly spend time at my boyfriend’s place. I consider myself a responsible, clean, kind, and social person, but I also value my alone time. I'm looking for a private, clean place with friendly people.	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 05:45:48.173	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 05:45:48.173	0

F1859204	Nate	$750/week•34 year old man	\N	Hey there!\n\nI’m Nate—a laid-back but driven Project Manager with 17 years in the construction industry. When I’m not managing projects, you’ll find me at the gym, by the ocean, at a cafe, experimenting with meal prep, or diving into design projects (Scandinavian style is my jam).\n\nI’ve been living with an incredible roommate I met through Flatmates for the past two years, and it’s been an awesome experience! Sadly, she’s moving east, so I’m on the hunt for a new living setup in Perth. Here’s what I’m looking for:\n\nLiving Situation: Open to teaming up with someone for a new lease or finding my own place up to my budget range.\n\nBudget: Flexible with splitting costs based on room size if we team up.\n\nAvailability: The current lease in Bicton ends on 02/12, but I’m happy to move earlier for the right fit.\n\nPreferred Home: A respectful, chill, and peaceful place to call home for the next 6-12 months.\n\nLocation: Ideally, it is coastal Perth areas. I work in Applecross but spend most of my free time by the sea.\n\nLifestyle: I’m into outdoor adventures, live gigs, camping, moderate CrossFit sessions, gardening, and beach time. I value clear communication, keeping things tidy, and a balanced living environment.\n\nIf you’re keen to create a great space with good vibes, balanced living, and maybe some solid banter, let’s chat and see if we can find the perfect place together!	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 05:56:27.243	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 05:56:27.243	0

F2982797	Morgan	$400/week•27 year old woman	\N	Currently living in Noosa Heads, looking for another 6 - 12 month lease.\nI’m a house proud lady who is clean, respectful, reliable and considerate of others. \n\nLIFESTYLE: \nI live a healthy lifestyle and love being outdoors in nature. In my spare time I like to get down to the Noosa National Park for a swim/surf/snorkel/ hike and also enjoy going to the gym and practicing Pilates/ yoga regularly. \nI rarely drink, don’t smoke/ do drugs however love to go out to dinner/ dancing. \n\nHOUSEMATES:\nI’m an easy person to live with; I’m mindful of others, clean (organic/ low tox products) and respectful of space. Ideally, I would like to live with others who have the same values and find housemates that I can be friends with, surf/ gym/ go on hikes with but also be respectful of personal space and alone time.\n\nHOUSE: \nI'm flexible with living arrangements - I'm keen to join an existing household or find 3-4 other people or to team up and rent a large house of our own. I’m looking for a larger house, preferably timber floors (no carpet), large bedrooms with separate bathrooms and a study. Ideally in a quiet street (low car noise) with a natural outlook. I’m currently doing inspections that fit this criteria and can link you to properties I think would be good. \n\nCurrently looking at a large fully furnished property in Sunrise Beach or Noosa Heads. \nPlease message me and I will link you to the details :) \n	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 05:54:35.798	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 05:54:35.798	0

F4199678	Hannah	$250/week•23 year old woman	\N	I am a 23 year old Speech Pathology student at the University of Newcastle, about to commence the fourth and final year of my degree. I will be completing an honours research thesis in between my studies and travelling around the coast frequently for placement, so I am looking for a quiet place to study and relax after a busy day.\n\nSince moving out of home, I have always been in shared accommodation, both on and off campus, so I value keeping a home tidy and respecting others’ spaces. I am a non-smoker, with no pets or children, and I am financially stable.\n\nI consider myself to be friendly, hard-working, reliable and responsible and I like to show pride in my own space. When I’m not studying, I’m usually out adventuring, either rock climbing or at the beach, or relaxing at home. I enjoy cooking, gardening, reading and music, and have enjoyed the occasional movie or games night with roommates in the past. I am looking for a relatively quiet place to call home, and hope to find roommates with similar interests and values.	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 05:45:43.643	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 05:45:43.643	0

F4204106	Rachel	$450/week•28 year old woman	\N	Hi, my name is Rachel 🩷\n\nA bit about me - I am 28 years old and I moved to the GC from Canberra in January 2024. I work full-time in the APS and you may find me travelling a few times a year for work. I work Mon-Friday - in the office (Brisbane) and from home. I have lived in share houses for 5-6 years and have loved meeting new people! Having lived in share houses before, I understand the importance of a comfortable, clean, peaceful environment.\n\nI am looking for a furnished (preferably) room to rent for 6-12 months. Super flexible with everything else (parking arrangements, bathroom, etc). My lease officially ends in January 2025, however, I am flexible with the move in date for the right place.\n\nI have an active lifestyle, I enjoy training at the gym, beach walks and I play OzTag! I am still slowly settling in and finding my bearings, so I am looking for a place where we aren’t just housemates and we can build a genuine friendship. I am a big foody, love exploring new places, socialising and having a glass of wine to un-wind after a long day. I am a big NRL fan, so apologies for the screaming whilst watching the games 😅\n\nLooking forward to meeting like-minded people and finding a new place to call home ☀️ 	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 05:45:48.173	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 05:45:48.173	0

F3572939	Gabriel	$350/week•21 year old man	\N	Hey I'm Gabriel :) \n\nI'm 21 years old looking for a nice home with some likeminded people. I've been in Melbourne for just over 2 years now! I grew up in Sydney but chose to relocate simply out of preference. Recently I was meaning to study Theatre in Manchester, however I found myself travelling Europe solo instead which was such a cool experience. For work I manage a cafe in Fitzroy which I really enjoy since it's such a sociable lively job. For interests I'm big on anything creative but drama, dance and visual arts are the main ones. \n\nIn terms of house sharing experience I have good 1.5 years under my belt, so I know how to be a pleasant and fun roommate. During this time I handled the lease/apartment for my previous residency. Thus, I’m well experienced with managing a property. I'm always up for a chat, dinner and all the usual housemate stuff. \n\nIf you think I’d be a good fit or have any other questions please let me know and I look forward to hearing from you.\nThanks & Have a Good Day 🫶 \n\n\n	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 05:54:37.941	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 05:54:37.941	0

F4141037	Oliver	$250/week•30 year old man	\N	My name is Oliver Park, and I’m looking for a share house starting from the last week of October. I’m well aware of how competitive the share house market is, so I wanted to introduce myself personally, allowing you to get to know me better as a potential flatmate. I’m hoping to find housemates with whom I can share a comfortable living environment, so I wanted to make a proper introduction.\n\nI’m a 30-year-old guy on a working holiday. I graduated from university in Korea with a major in Buddhist Studies and Meditation, and I worked for four years in marketing, which promotes traditional Korean culture.\n\nIt’s been one month since I started my working holiday here at AU. I’m currently in Brisbane, looking for a place near Eight Mile Plains or Runcorn, close to the M1 highway. I’m excited to meet some great housemates.\n\nI work on a construction site, and I typically wake up around 5 AM and finish work around 4 PM. I usually have dinner at home after work.\n\nI love nature and enjoy outdoor activities like hiking, running, and camping, so I often spend weekends doing these kinds of activities.\n\nI rarely drink, but I do enjoy a drink on occasion. I don’t smoke or do drugs at all. I’m easygoing and enjoy socializing with others.\n\nAdditionally, I’m very tidy and have a habit of cleaning regularly. I keep the bathroom very clean and always tidy up after using it. I do the dishes right after eating and clean up any oil splatters immediately after cooking.

F4192567	Cheskene	$350/week•26 year old man	\N	Hi, my name is Cheskene!\n\nI have been living in Sydney the past 3 years, and will be moving to the Gold Coast by December 2024 or January 2025 \n\nI have been working for a consulting company in Sydney as an Engineer since I graduated with my Master’s degree from UNSW earlier this year. \n\nI love playing basketball, running, spending time at the beach, and enjoying nature, going for walks, sunrises and sunsets. I try to sleep early and wake up before sunrise to go for a run. \n\nOn weekdays, I’ll be working full time. On the weekends, I’ll usually do chores, clean my room, do some meal prepping, go to church, spend time with friends/flatmates, and a bit of time for myself to recharge for the following week. \n\nCooking is one of my passions, and I’m happy to spend time cooking with my flatmates. \n\nI’m looking for a house or an apartment with a mix of men and women. I’m happy to team up and apply for places, or join an already existing sharehouse.\n\nMy house vibes are clean, and respectful, and family-oriented. I’m not a party person, and I don’t really drink, but I’m always looking forward to spending time with my flatmates whether that be movie nights, dinners together, sports and other fun bonding activities, so that we can bond and become closer to one another, much like friends or siblings. \n\nI also have a surfboard that I haven’t been able to use this year, and I’m hoping to use it more often when I move to Gold Coast.  \n\nI have also lived with people from more than 50 countries in the 2 years before this year, so I’m very open to cultural exchange and diverse perspectives. \n\nPlease send me a message if you’re interested. I’d be happy to chat and give you a chance to get to know me better. \n\nThanks,\nCheskene\n	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 05:56:53.324	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 05:56:53.324	0
F3285826	Rueben	$250/week•24 year old man	\N	Ciao! I’m hoping to find a groovy, warm, sharehouse to become a part of! \nI’ve had plenty of experience living in share houses and understand the need for clear communication, consideration, personal space and social effort.\n\n I am a tidy person all-round and I love a good communal space in a house. I love socialising just as much as I love solitude so I’ll never turn down a chat or a beverage but I’ll also try my best to not get in the way of downtime. \n\nI work 6 days a week as a teachers assistant in Austin’s ferry and also hospitality at room for a pony\n\nIn my spare time I’m teaching myself Mediterranean cooking (I have made a big slab of prosciutto that will finish curing just in time for summer), rock climbing, making jewellery, sitting in the bush or the beach and going through my music collection. \n\nI’ve got plenty of art and a good attitude to bring along to my future household and I can’t wait to share both of those things. \n \nI’m open to most living situations and I’d love to move in any time from right now :^)\n\n\n\n	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 05:45:22.701	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 05:45:22.701	0

F4182791	Vitaliya	$300/week•20 year old woman	\N	Hi! I'm a bilingual 20 y/o who's moving from Melbourne to study filmmaking and writing. Looking forward to finding some house mates to make the dream of studying in Sydney just a little easier.\n\nI've grown up in a Russian household so I'm a person who highly values cooperation, personal space, cleanliness, and has a standard for chores and rosters. I love animals of all kinds and wouldn't mind a housemate with a parrot or cat (I'm experienced in looking after both). But I also would hope to be flexible as due to study and socialising I'm not going to be in the house 24/7.\n\nI'm hoping to find a housemate that I can be friends with and geek out about anything and everything, but also someone that is responsible and will mirror back a serious approach when needed. 	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 05:45:48.173	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 05:45:48.173	0

F4196956	Isabella	$450/week•29 year old woman	\N	Hi, I’m Izzy 😊 I am 29 and I'm a full-time professional working in the city, typically out from 7am to 6pm on weekdays.\nI’m trying to get back into the gym so I’ll probably be spending a lot of time there.\nOn weekends I like to keep myself busy, I like going for day trips outside of Sydney, indulging in art, brunch, beach days during summer, and other typical "girl" activities. I am also starting to learn how to play golf, so I’ll probably spend my weekends playing golf!\nWhile I enjoy the occasional night out, I'm not much of a party person. I don’t mind spending a Saturday night at home with a good movie and a glass of wine. \nI would like to live with people who are easy-going, enjoy a good laugh, and are up for socializing over drinks or dinner from time to time.\n\nAlthough I can make other arrangements, I would love to brink my cat Chester with me. He is the definition of demure, very adorable and also very spoilt. Despite his royal treatment, he's quiet and shy, usually likes snoozing under my bed or curled up in his own space in the sunlight. I’m allergic to cats myself, so I try and keep the place as clean and tidy as possible.\n\nI have all my furtiture/appliances that I can contribute to the house, if not already available. \n\nPlease let me know if you think we could be a good match :) 	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 05:56:49.234	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 05:56:49.234	0

I’m clean and tidy, respectful of other people's space, and like to cook healthy-ish meals at home.	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 05:55:03.099	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 05:55:03.099	0

F4172011	Millie	$270/week•28 year old woman	\N	Hey there! I’m Millie(sanghui lee), and I’m from South Korea. I recently worked as a barista in Melbourne, and I’m super excited to explore another city, which is why I’ve come to the lovely Townsville!\n\nI’m looking for a cozy and welcoming home to start my journey in this tropical paradise. I absolutely love coffee and enjoy creating latte art—it feels like a healing therapy for me! There’s nothing quite like the smell of fresh coffee and the joy of seeing friends savoring a cup I made.\n\nI plan to work as a barista here in Townsville too. In my free time, I love watching movies, listening to music, and reading books. I also have a knack for keeping things tidy and organized—I believe a clean space helps me feel comfortable and focused.\n\nI really enjoy meeting new friends and sharing stories together, but just to clarify, that doesn’t mean I’m into parties everyday! Haha. During my university days, I had the chance to study abroad and live in a dorm with friends from various countries. We created our own rules and supported each other in our shared community life. I also lived in a share house in Melbourne, where I built a great relationship with my housemates and landlord. Even after leaving, we still share meals and keep in touch!\n\nI’m excited to find a warm room and a friendly housemate to share stories with, and I can’t wait to meet you! Thank you so much, and have a wonderful day! 	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 05:49:46.91	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 05:49:46.91	0

I’m here to pursue my dream of becoming an Australian resident and am on the lookout for a place to call home, whether it’s short-term or long-term. I’ve got a laid-back and positive vibe, having been on a personal growth journey since 2019 and, especially in the past year, really diving into self-care and new opportunities after ending an 11-year marriage.\n\nProfessionally, I’m a Chef with nearly five years of experience in the aged care industry and am currently exploring new career opportunities and sponsorships as a Chef or Chef Manager. My lifestyle is all about balance and staying active — I’m into workouts, running, yoga, breathwork, meditation, music, art, and connecting with people who share a similar mindset. I’m looking for a comfortable, welcoming space to settle into, and I’d love to share good energy and life experiences with others who value a mindful approach to life.\n\nIf you think I’d be a great fit for your place or community, let me know, and we can arrange a time for me to pop by, check out the room, and have a chat in person. I’m excited to see what this new chapter in Perth has in store and am hoping to find a space where I can feel right at home.\n\nThanks so much for your time and attention for now, and I look forward to meeting you!\n\nHave an awesome day! 👊🏼🤟🏼\n\nRaphael	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 05:48:30.7	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 05:48:30.7	0

I'm a 31-year-old from The Netherlands and after working on yachts for 7 years I am ready to live a normal life in Sydney:) I am aiming to get a fulltime job as a barista and am currently based in Bondi where I would ideally like to settle down. However I am open to surrounding neighbourhoods as well.\nI am very clean and tidy and easy to live with. I have lived with many people in very small spaces and can confidently say I get on with everyone.\nI don't want to be strangers from my flatmates, so would love to be able to yap over a wine (or tea) every now and then. I definitely also have my own life going on so also happy to do my own thing.\n\nIn my free time I like to get outdoors and hang out with friends at the beach, bars or go for long walks. I also enjoy running, crochet, reading a book on the beach, finding new coffeeshops to buy over priced coffees and playing playing board and card games. \n\nI am excited to find the perfect place to call home and connect with my new flatmates :)	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 05:48:11.616	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 05:48:11.616	0

Brad has just started his business in marine and mechanic work and I have part time work on the side. We have a steady income and feel very comfortable and will continue doing so. \n\nWe currently live at Coomera with a family member which has been a lovely time but we are now at the stage where we are wanting to start a fresh chapter me and him. \nWe are seeking 1-2 bedrooms and between 1-2 bathrooms. Reasonable price between $300-550 a week would be ideal. We are pretty flexible with arranging times to meet etc…. We would love to rent the whole place out for just me and him knowing we can come home everyday feeling happy in our own space and working off our own times. But if that isn’t an option at the moment, we possibly would be open to sharing with a flat mate, whether that’s a keep to themselves kind of person or a lovely couple. In saying that we are lovely people who are kind, respectful and well mannered. Just cruisy people really. \n\nA bit about us in terms of hobbies and who we are. Myself personally I love a relaxed, tidy environment, I am obsessed with the beach, gym and love going on spontaneous adventures. My partner also would agree to keeping to himself, gyming, active work lifestyle, who has the sweetest sole and his manners are one of his best traits. We both love to focus on what we are doing and do our own thing. Go getters from the heart and have a strong driven mindset. \n\nIWe are looking for straight away move in date as we have planned out what the next few weeks will hopefully look like for us.\n\nThankyou so much 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 05:48:11.616	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 05:48:11.616	0

F3582058	Bien	$175/week•22 year old man	\N	Hi! My name is Bien and I'm looking at opportunities to move out of home for my independence and own space. I'm flexible with lease duration from 6-12 months. I have rented by myself and with a flatmate previously while living in Brissy for about 1.5 years, prior to moving back home again. I'm currently undertaking my Commerical Pilot's Licence course in Jandakot, although I'm on a break from flying to work and refocus until the start of next year. I'm otherwise working part-time as a boarding supervisor at a high-school. My work schedule for next school term will have me out 3 days a week Friday arvo until Saturday arvo as I stay overnight, and then the entire day Sunday.\n\nKeeping things clean and tidy is important to me and I enjoy my own space, but would love to meet new people and have a room-mate I can get along with! I plan on working and studying most of the time but it would be great to get along with someone at home. I'd ideally love to be in a place with a good balance of privacy and socialising.  SOR or closish to Jandakot or the freeway is ideal but I'm fairly flexible with location.	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 05:56:53.324	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 05:56:53.324	0

F4192680	Rein Blunt	$500/week•43 year old man	\N	Hi there, potential housemates and homeowners! I'm Rein – yep, just like the deer, minus the sleigh and red suit. I’m a non-smoker, non-drinker, no kids or pets, just good vibes and a knack for keeping things chill. I recently migrated south from Brisbane to Sydney and am now on a quest to find a home that I can fill with good energy and zero drama.\n\nBy day, I’m a corporate wizard in the Learning &amp; Development space, teaching people things they never knew they needed to know. After hours? I swap the boardroom for the mosh pit! I film concerts for some of the biggest names in music—Matchbox Twenty, Goo Goo Dolls, Incubus, Spiderbait, Airbourne, Steel Panther and more. If you've ever wanted to live with someone who works with rockstars but is still humble enough to stack the dishwasher properly, I'm your guy.\n\nHome is my sanctuary, my chill zone. So, while I’m out there hustling and making things happen in the corporate world or rocking out at gigs, that when I am home, I like to keep things zen. No wild parties here (unless you count my 3D printer quietly humming in the background while I create something innovative and cool). I’m also a big fan of clean spaces, because who doesn’t like to come home to a place that actually feels like home?\n\nI’m financially secure, always pay rent and bills in advance (because adulting is easier when you’re ahead of the game), and I’ve been renting all my life. So, If you're looking for a respectful, fun, and hard-working housemate who also has a killer playlist (and maybe free concert tickets from time to time), and who loves to bake, (cakes are my jam, literally!) then I think we’ll get along just fine!	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 06:07:18.135	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 06:07:18.135	0

F4171198	Aman	$300/week•31 year old non-binary	\N	Hi there,\n\nFairly chill human here looking for a some walls and a roof preferraly with a door for myself and my doggo Lucy. \n\nI cook, I clean and I garden when I am at home and if I am not doing these things I am studying. When im not at home, I work as a gardener. Generally I am out for most of the day for work, sometimes Lucy comes with me too. \n\nI like to go out to Karaoke on Friday nights or host boardgame nights on weekdays when I have the energy/time. Other than that its mostly some tele followed by bed. On the weekends I visits friends and family in Sydney/Wollongong or volunteer in treating wombats who have mange in the Megalong Valley (always looking for more volunteers if you wanna do your bit for the Wombats!)\n\nLucy is 9 yo blue healer and a total cutie patootie. She also has an insatiable need for pats. She loves to play fetch and if there is a toy nearby, you may or may not find it in your lap shortly. \n\nIdeally I am looking for a room in a sharehouse that has a fenced in backyard where Lucy can exist safely. No qualms as to number of housemates, just so long as the house is tidy and everyone pitches in on house duties and deeper house cleans. Bonus if the house has a spare room that I could use as a massage studio/yoga/exercise space from time to time!	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 05:57:20.352	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 05:57:20.352	0

F997022	Tim	$270/week•50 year old man	\N	I am a very quiet guy and tend to keep to myself.I read a lot and spend a lot of time on my computer. I am a tidy and clean person. I do not smoke .I like a quiet drink or 2 but never to excess and not very often.\nI am happy to help with chores and i keep any communal areas very clean. In my bedroom i can be a little messy but not dirty. The messiness is generally clothes since i tend to live out of 2 washing baskets, 1 for clean clothes and one for dirty. \nI am an animal lover and have 2 cats which i cant leave behind they are my responsibility. They are both desexed and had shots and are very well house trained. They have a scratching post they love to use. She is not a super cuddly cat and prefers her time alone usually in the backyard under a bush or tree. He is a super friendly and loving cat that will demand a pat. Both prefer to go outside for their toilet tho they are kitty litter trained. I like to put in either a cat flap in a door or in flyscreen of a window to give them access and this of course is replaced back to original when the time comes. They have never caused any damage to a house.\nMy bills get paid on time and i am easy to get along with and talk to. Most of my time is spent either on my computer with headphones on so the noise does not affect anyone else or laying down in bed reading. \nTho i like my privacy i have nothing to hide and will answer any questions, i believe in openness with housemates as talking about any issues is much healthier than not dealing with it. \nWould much prefer to find somewhere long term.\nDisregard the dogs in the photo they are not mine :)\nI do have some health issues which is why i am retired and living on a disability pension. I can look after myself but due to lung problems i do snore. \nAnd please everyone answer a message if someone sends one to you. Don't leave people wondering...	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 05:57:20.352	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 05:57:20.352	0

F1879964	Sammy	$350/week•33 year old woman	\N	Hi 👋🏼 my name is Sammy.\n\nI run my own business in Product Management Consultancy in the tech space and I do this from home, cafes, libraries and occasionally a co-working space. So I am looking for a place where taking the odd zoom call isn't a problem. I don't necessarily need an office or massive room and am comfortable working from the loungeroom and in open spaces.\n\nI like to be social with my housemates, building a great relationship together but like everyone I also like my downtime for rest.\n\nLove being by the beach and I believe our environment heavily impacts our well-being. Living somewhere beautiful with cheery people is my jam.\n\nDuring the week I go for lots of walks, the gym, yoga and recovery places like saunas etc. on the weekends I'll do anything to get outside, surfing, camping, the rail trail, time on the water is my happy place.\n\nI have started seeing someone, he occasionally spends a night at my place but as he owns his own home I do tend to spend more nights there with him.\n\nI've been share housing for forever so I'm a pretty well trained, easy going housemate. I tend to take on the habits of my housemates, so if you like it sparkling clean I'll try my best. If you're more relaxed I'll also be that way!	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 06:08:48.912	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 06:08:48.912	0

F2940582	Ana Rita Miranda	$250/week•36 year old woman	\N	Hi there! I'm a Portuguese solo traveller. \nBeen in Australia for almost 5 years now, travelled and worked across most states, and lived with a lot of different nationalities.\n\nI am looking for a quiet house, tidy and clean where I can chill. I'm social and enjoy sharing a drink every now and then, but home is where i charge my batteries so I'm usually just chillin on my own.\n\nI'm an early riser and usually in bed early, so being in a house where someone's cooking dinner at 10pm wouldn't really be the best fit.\nI'm always super considerate about my mates so appreciate when they act the same way towards me.\n\nI do like to have occasionally a friend over for a chat, share a meal, but definitely not the type of person that will have gatherings all the time, so wouldn't like to end up in a house that busy.\n\nI love the beach, I love food, and enjoy surfing. I like going out for that sunset beer, or a homemade cheese and wine, but also, I love doing lots of nothing! I'm pescatarian, and really don't mind about anyone else's dietary as long as you clean after yourself that's all I care.\n\nThis is me folks! I hope to find a suitable house. Looking forward to meet you 🌼\n	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 06:08:29.358	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 06:08:29.358	0

We are currently looking for a new home out of my parents home to call home and where I can just focus on the little one and working! \nNot only am I reliable so the issue of rent not being sent in on time will never be a problem with me, but I am also responsible, so I will look after the property like it is my own and treat it accordingly. I can create and maintain a healthy relationship between neighbours and landlord as I believe communication between all is necessary in a neighbourhood. Baby and I adore outdoors so if we’re not in the house with our routines you will most likely find us strolling somewhere around the neighbourhood. \nI am an inside mother so I do not go outdoors and I keep my friendship group to a minimum so people coming over everyday is not my ideal type of living as I love my personal space. \n\n	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 05:57:55.993	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 05:57:55.993	0

F4053220	Hayley	$400/week•30 year old woman	\N	Hi! I'm Hayley :) (I'm in the middle of my profile picture) I'm 30 years old and moved to Melbourne from the Pacific NW in the U.S. 8 months ago. I work full-time as a speech-pathologist mostly in the community and office, but occasionally from home. I have 1 car, as I need to drive for work. I have loads of experience living in shared housing, and like to keep a relatively clean home. I am pretty independent and keep to myself, but also love socializing and having a nice community at home, chatting at the end of the day, movie/tv nights, going out to events or for dinner some evenings and weekends. I'm a cross between a home-body and a busy-body-- I love to chill at home, as well as going out and exploring. I don't really drink (I'm more of a tea drinker), but don't mind if others do. Outside of work I love reading, movies, being active (walking, hiking, exercise classes), and hanging out with friends. \nI'm looking for my own room in shared housing with other similar-age, professional, easygoing flatmates, ideally in an inner-city suburb. Would love my own bathroom, but I don't mind sharing. I'm looking to move in ASAP, but willing to wait for the right fit! Let me know if you have any other questions :)	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 05:58:23.468	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 05:58:23.468	0

F3126817	Shannessy	$350/week•29 year old woman	\N	Hello lovely humans!\n\nHere's a little spiel about me: Shannessy, she/her, I work full-time in digital mental health, which I love. I have a second job at an arts centre (because, the economy). I am a performer as well, specifically burlesque and cabaret, but I also do some directing too. \n\nI am super passionate about movement (pilates, yoga), self-development, creative expression, and I love being around people who challenge my worldview and inspire me to grow. I really enjoy connecting with new people and I am often out seeing friends/my partner, going to classes, or having a boogie, but I would also love a home where I can feel comfortable unwinding, creating, and relaxing in. \n\nAll that said, I am big on communication and enjoy a clean, communal environment, and I would enjoy a genuine friendship with the people I live with. Let me know if this is something you resonate with or if you have any questions. \n\nI am keen to meet and learn more about you too! (Hopefully over a soy iced latte or our favourite music.)\n\n	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 06:09:37.133	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 06:09:37.133	0

I actually thoroughly enjoy cleaning ahaha put on some tunes and I’m away! \n\nI rarely go out drinking etc these days, I lack the energy to with how much I’m working 🤣\nBut definitely love to go out every so often \n\nI appreciate my quiet time to myself and I’ll always respect yours, but will always chat your ear off when the times right🥰	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 06:01:28.617	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 06:01:28.617	0

F4161662	Cain	$310/week•21 year old man	\N	Hey!\n\nMy name is Cain McKean, I am a Coolum Beach local, 21 years old and in my last two months of my plumbing apprenticeship. I currently live with my parents and I am looking to move out of home for the first time. \nI work quite long hours as I take on all the extra after hours work when it's available. I’m open minded and outgoing.\n\nIn my free time I love to go camping with my friends, I am an avid fisherman, and I ride motocross. My parents live in Coolum Beach but they also have a large farm in the hinterland and I spend a lot of weekends there riding motocross (we have our own track) and helping my dad and grandpa with general farm duties. I love the peace and tranquil nature of being out there, but equally love being on the coast to go fishing, camping, swimming, going out for dinner etc.\n\nI have very stable full time  employment and I have been trained by my parents to be clean and tidy and respectful. I currently live in their downstairs granny flat, which is self-contained, and I am expected to keep it to a proper rental standard. I hope that I can be given a chance to prove myself as a respectable tenant, as this is my first time moving out of home, so I don't have available the references and or rental history etc.\n \nI am looking for somewhere to stay for around 6-12 months and or longer if it suits… \n\nThankyou.	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 06:01:35.526	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 06:01:35.526	0

My main hobbies are travelling, working on my cars, reading, playing the bass and going to gigs. I’m looking for a shared house, flat or even my own unit and would love to hear from you. I’d also like to add that i’m very punctual with my rent payments and whilst I might be young. I’m a quiet and respectful roommate/neighbour. I’m happy to answer any and all questions you might have 😀. \n\nbest regards\n\nSarit 	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 06:01:06.169	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 06:01:06.169	0

Ideally looking for something close to the beach, a decent size room with natural light, a built in and a good size yard for the pup! I would prefer to live with just one other who’s is close in age but open to two if the vibe was right :) Home is like a little sanctuary so looking for somewhere that’s peaceful, light filled and feels good to be in.\n\nEasy going person, love the ocean and surfing. Love to cook when i have time, and love having cook ups and drinks with the housemates every so often. I’m in my smutty fantasy book reading era.\n\nI don’t mind having a have a beer on the weekend when Im not working but not a big partier and not looking for a party house or a place that does kick ons! \n\nI work as a nurse doing cosmetic injectables a couple days a week and do shift at the hospital as well.\n\nI also have a 6yr old Kelpie x Staffy named Grommie! He is the sweetest happiest boy and everyone that meets him just loves him. He is an indoor outdoor dog and is known to come cuddle on the lounge (if it’s allowed) and sleeps in my room, so above all else looking for a place that he can still do that. He gets along great with other dogs as long as they’ve been introduced properly and I think he would prefer to have a doggy playmate!\n\nLived in plenty of shares houses before, I clean up after myself and Grom. Let me know if you might have something suitable. Places I’m looking are Merewether and surrounds, Dudley, Redhead, Whitebridge or Charlestown on the coastal side :)\n\nCheers	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 06:01:45.251	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 06:01:45.251	0

F3852233	Dasha	$395/week•26 year old woman	\N	Hi! I'm Dasha, I work at St. Vincent's Hospital in Darlinghurst as a technical assistant in the pathology lab! I'm generally a quiet, laid back, clean and low maintenance person who likes doing things in her own time and with her own space, however, will try to socialise if invited to do so. I like to draw, play video games and listen to music, and like to generally do most things on my own. I don't mind quiet housemates or loud housemates, I just love having that company.\nI'm looking for a fun change of environment. I work very early in the morning so being as close to the hospital is ideal for me. 	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 06:01:59.533	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 06:01:59.533	0

This makes my weeks full of either class days, or days out in the field having fun hiking, canoeing or mountain biking. Later in the week you’ll find me at work, fuelling my caffeine addiction as a barista. I can be a pretty busy bee, but I love to have some down time when I get the chance. This can look like time spent playing some guitar (acoustic so don’t worry about me being loud), reading, watching some movies, cooking up a good feast. \nI would really love to move into a place that I could call home, not just a place to sleep, and preferably with people my age. I really look forward to building some awesome relationships with some funky peeps.\nFeel free to send me a message if you’ve got any questions or want to chat more.\nThanks everyone.	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 06:01:32.413	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 06:01:32.413	0

I love being outdoors as much as possible whether running, bush walking, camping or beach. \nI'm a social being so often out and about though I do need down time. I’m very partial to a mid-week yarn and drink or dinner but I respect others space and privacy. I like to keep my own and communal space clean and tidy.\nI enjoy coffee (addiction, help), dogs (I have a kelpie cross who lives with my folks, hopefully she can visit wherever I land), cooking, travelling (I want to see more of Australia!), skiing, exploring markets, pickling and fermenting (recently nailed sauerkraut) and so on. \nI moved home from London late last year and I’m now transitioning to Newcastle from Sydney. So I’m looking for a place to call home with friendly like-minded people.\nI’d love to find somewhere near the beach (Cooks Hill, Bar Beach, The Junction, Mereweather etc.) with one or two other people. Flexible move in date, ideally sometime in November. I’m looking for somewhere long term but would be open to sublet for a few months. 	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 06:01:45.251	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 06:01:45.251	0

We are from New Zealand and Jess has just spent the last 3 months travelling abroad. \nI (Milly) work full time within the film world set dressing and I hope to continue in the industry over in Melbourne. When I'm not working I love to dive into film photography and music, also doing various forms of art\nJess is a musician/dj/producer and does a lot of work within this industry. Jess is extremely passionate about music and has built quite a foundation of work doing so, and hopes to build her way up in Melbourne also! \nWe are both extremely tidy and respectful of our spaces, making sure to always clean up after ourselves and stay on top of house chores. We like a social hang and flat dinner but also love to have our own time/are very mindful of others needing this too.\nWe are ideally looking for a 1 bed place, but are also keen on sublets/rooms available in the first few months while we are getting on our feet. This could mean sublets of a couple months - not necessarily longterm if its the right fit etc! 	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-31 03:49:03.171	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-31 03:49:03.171	0

F3563400	Ellie	$300/week•21 year old woman	\N	Hey! My name is Ellie and I’m looking for a new place to move into and call home. \n\nPEOPLE MY AGE ,, I AM NOT INTERESTED IN LIVING WITH AN OLDER MAN****\n\nA little bit about me ~ I’m 21 years old , grew up in Perth , Western Australia , although I am half Italian on my dad’s side. \nI am currently living with my mother , I housesat for her for just over a year now while she was travelling along the Nullarbor and around Australia. \nI have lived in lots of sharehouses, and have also rented privately, so feel confident in me being responsible in my tenancy. \nI am currently studying at north metropolitan tafe studying my certificate 3 in community services , 3 days a week and also work as a waitress at 3 sheets in hillarys part time.\nI have been transparent in my message so I can find the most accomodated , comfortable and cozy home. \nI do suffer from quite intense social anxiety and share houses have often been a struggle for me as I feel like the people in the house weren’t really interested in forming friendships , rather just having someone to occupy the space and pay rent. I am looking for a place where I can build a friendship with the females / males in the house with clear communication making it a healthy happy house for us all. I look forward to hearing from you!	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 06:10:08.733	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 06:10:08.733	0

F4142677	Jake	$400/week•26 year old man	\N	26-year-old male who is currently looking for a more private accomodation to rent for the next 12 months. Was hoping to to have my own bathroom due to OCD and how clean I like my residence to be. Ensuite would be required willing to pay the associate costs for it.  Would be prefer female as im gay but not fussed either way.  However I would much prefer to have a space that’s disconnected from any shared living arrangements such as the below. \n\nA granny flat would be the most ideal form of accommodation however I am flexible, I only make this request as I have completely indoor cat, very well toilet trained and has been through immense behaviour training so as you can imagine he is a very “good boy” doesn’t destroy anything or make any noise besides the faint make when I get home from work.  But to make it more interesting and hence why I have asked for more private accommodation is I have an albino Darwin carpet python (the yellow and white in colour however the enclosure is quiet large) \n\nI’m a full time hospitality worker where my shift range from 7pm-4:30am or 8am - 6pm so as you could imagine I’m a busy man. However I keep to keep to myself and usually spend my little spare time rest and removing with my little side kick rigby (cat). \n\nHope to hear from you soon \n\n	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-31 03:49:06.168	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-31 03:49:06.168	0

I like to take care of my health, so don't party at all, or drink much (the occasional weekend glass of wine).\n\nI currently work as a support worker but will be looking for new work once I move. :)	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 06:10:52.198	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 06:10:52.198	0

My budget is around $300 a week. Im currently working at a bar and wine shop in the cbd and would like to live with others working in hospitality. I’ve spent the last year living in Collingwood and have spent 4 years in shared housing at university and would make a respectful housemate.\n\nIm into rock climbing and bouldering, going to the gym and playing rugby. Im a decent cook and also get 20% off great bottles of wines. I also love going to gigs and events in the city.\n\nIf you think I’d be a good fit, hit me up :)	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 06:05:29.136	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 06:05:29.136	0

I've been sharing for the last 8 years successfully (usually with my own properties) and have a reputation for being incredibly tidy/ quiet and dependable, able to balance friendship and giving people space and that I'm thoughtful/kind and generous. I like to keep home tranquil and rather go out if socialising. When not working I like to travel, swim, catch up with friends, cook and I exercise almost every day. I have a clean lifestyle apart from an occasional drink with friends.\n\nI'm looking for my own room , bathroom and somewhere off the street to park my car. Apart from that I'm open and flexible with the rest. Probably looking for my own place in the long term.\n\nHappy to organise an initial video chat to begin the process.	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 06:04:51.609	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 06:04:51.609	0

In the meantime, I've been working as a chef here in Australia.\n\nI have a girlfriend (argentina) who lives and works on Rottnest Island. She got a sponsorship, and she may stay over occasionally, but like couple of times every 2 months. I think I’ll be the one visiting Rottnest more than she will. I’m mostly looking for a place for myself, but if I need to pay as a couple, that’s fine.\n\nI’m a clean and respectful person, not much of a partygoer. I prefer surfing, spending time outdoors, and meeting new people. I hope there’s a chance we can meet and chat sometime. Thanks!	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 06:06:00.796	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 06:06:00.796	0

F3957771	Nicole	$400/week•32 year old woman	\N	I HAVE A 4 year old cool, social CHIHUAHUA! \nHi there! I'm a 32-year-old woman who loves the simplicity and coziness of living in a studio. As an introverted individual, I find solace in my own space. I work part-time, allowing me to have plenty of time to indulge in my passions. Music is my ultimate escape; it speaks to my soul and brings me immense joy. Alongside music, I have a deep appreciation for nature and enjoy spending time outdoors, whether it's hiking or simply taking a stroll in the park. Science fascinates me, and I love keeping up with the latest discoveries and advancements. In my free time, you'll often find me playing sports or cuddling with my beloved pets. As an LGBTQIA+ individual, creating a safe and inclusive environment is important to me. I don't have any kids but cherish the companionship of my furry friends. Being a non-smoker, I prioritize clean and fresh air in my home. Overall, I'm content with a quiet and peaceful lifestyle that allows me to fully immerse myself in the things that bring me happiness.	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 06:06:23.395	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 06:06:23.395	0

I come as a combo package with my super affectionate 5 year old dog Richie. He’s a medium sized boy of indistinct lineage (adopted) whose main goal in life is to wrap everyone he meets around his paw. \n\nI work standard hours Monday to Friday (mix of wfh and on the road), with occasional regional travel. Through the week I usually keep it fairly low-key with work, gym, dog-walks, Netflix etc. On the weekends I’ll usually be exploring new bars / restaurants, seeing live music and taking Richie on various nature trails in and around Melbourne. \n\nI have some flexibility around move dates but ideally looking for early November - will consider moving into an established share house if it’s the right fit or signing onto a new lease with someone! \n\nNow for some dot points:\n- clean and tidy individual, especially around the common areas of the home \n- keen to be mates with my housemate, but I’m also respectful of personal space. I understand we all need to recharge the social batteries sometimes\n- I play a bit of music, guitar and keyboard (during social hours), so would be great to live with someone who also likes music!\n- very open and approachable with communication and committed to making sure we all feel at home in the home\n\nShoot me a message if I sound like we’d be a good fit :) 	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 06:05:29.136	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 06:05:29.136	0

I am understanding of personal space and always fair when it comes to household rules and communication.\n\nMy daschunds name is Charlie and she is quite the good girl! She is socialised and she just loves walking playing and sleeping. I am a responsible pet parent and do what is needed to tire her out and keep her happy.\n\nI feel it is important that I mention this upfront as I understand not everyone is 100% accepting of pets! however Charlie would make a great companion to another small easygoing pet.\n\n\nSide notes:\n\nI do have a partner that lives 1.5 hrs away, so I usually would be out with charlie visiting him on weekends. If there was a chance he could visit me every now and again that would be cool also.\n\nLooking to rent for 12 months or long term if it's suitable- if that helps you at all with future planning.\n\nIt does take me a little while to open up to new people 😶 so I probably wont be the life of the party but I am always down for for a walk/coffee/explore and a glass of wine. I enjoy equal amounts of quiet time for reading or life admin etc.\n\nI'm really pretty chill and happy to make this work around you if you're willing to have someone bobbing around your place. 	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 06:06:23.395	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 06:06:23.395	0

F4007220	Lauren and Chris	$450/week•34-37 year old woman and man	\N	Hello everyone!\n\nWe’re Chris (38) and Lauren (34), moving out of our current abode on the Sunshine Coast due to some structural problems. We’re hoping to find a granny flat/studio/tiny home/space (ideally two rooms) in a sharehouse that’s okay with couples — even perhaps a setup in a homestay or on-the-land kind of situation. Chris is a budding permaculturalist and wants somewhere he can plant all kinds of flora and retrofit some systems; I simply adore nature and want to be somewhere I can wander around forests, mountains, or water. I'm a support worker/writer/photographer who does some work from home, some out in the community.\n\nWe’re both pretty spiritual, earthy, affable people who love our peace and quiet and early nights — though we’ll hit up the odd gig or festival or cultural event that catches our interest, not to mention share in deep and engaging conversations about our wonderful, quirky world (sociable introverts, you could call us). We would be looking to move ideally somewhere in the mid-range of SC (Buderim, Palmwoods, Yandina etc., inland or coastal; would consider as far up as Doonan or Eumundi or down towards Caloundra/Currimundi) as soon as possible, though we'll need to give our current landlords at least two weeks' notice to move. Our budget is somewhere between the $250-450 mark, depending on the space; we’re open to discussion should we stumble on our dream place.\n\nCurious to see what options are out there. We’re really excited for a change of pace and scenery, and the prospect of new communities and living more in flow with nature. Let us know if you have any questions, and maybe have the right abode for us! Much gratitude ✨🌱	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 06:11:11.323	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 06:11:11.323	0
F4195012	Bella	$250/week•20 year old woman	\N	Hi, \n\nI am looking at potentially moving out of home, but currently have no one to join me. I have lived in rentals for the majority of my life so have a good foundation and understanding of my responsibilities as a tenant. \n\nI am currently studying Computer Science part-time, and also work a customer service x retail job part-time. I admire and have a passion for the arts. In my spare time I typically nap, watch YouTube, Netflix, TikTok, or Spiral. I like to cook as well, and will often be happy to cook for multiple people. \n\nI also have a cat! Her name is Scarlett, she's a massive cuddler and I'm pretty sure she's gay.  Scarlett is super adorable, I don't think she has a brain in her head, and she may be slightly vision impaired (she is a little imbred). She also has no teeth!!! (except for a couple ones at the front). \n\nI am introverted and like having time to myself to wind down, however, if something comes up that I am particularly interested in (depending on my mood) I won't be afraid to share. I will be 100% honest, while I appreciate a clean and tidy place I do have ADHD so can struggle to consistently maintain upkeep. Typically I will need expectations clearly laid out, time frames also help to ensure upkeep. If something needs to be done let me know and I will be happy to fix it up. \n\nI am hoping to find a roommate who is empathetic and aligns with me politically (lefty). Also AC!! I have fairly significant sensory processing issues, especially around the heat. While I understand that I may not be able to find a place within my price range with AC in the bedroom I will require AC somewhere in the house especially with summer coming up. \n\nIf you feel you are interested in learning more please don't hesitate to give me a shout!	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 06:06:48.335	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 06:06:48.335	0

F4167774	Jed	$350/week•23 year old man	\N	G'day my name is Jed \n\nIve been working as a support worker for the past five years which has helped me develop a knack for understanding and adapting to the needs of people, which I think translates well into being a considerate and adaptable housemate. \n\nI’m laid-back and easygoing, always ready to lend a hand or offer a listening ear. My experience in handling complex situations has made me organized and empathetic, ensuring a smooth and harmonious living environment.\n\nOutside of work, I love surfing and playing basketball, so there’s always a good chance I’ll be up for a friendly game or a day out. I keep things tidy and am always up for sharing laughs and making our home a fun and relaxed space.\n\nHope you meet you soon :)	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-31 03:49:06.294	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-31 03:49:06.294	0

I've been living in sharehouses for the last 2 years since moving from Sydney. My ideal location would be near SCUH in walking or bike riding distance and being near the beach is a hopeful priority. \n\nI'm a tidy person and always happy to share tasks around the house. I will be at placement Monday-Friday all year, and at home during the week will mostly be studying. So not looking for a party house.\n\nI'm a massive outdoors person, love going for walks and swims at the beach and am an early riser. I love being social and don't know anyone outside uni in the sunny coast so ideally looking for similar minded people who are happy to have a chat, grab some food or go for a walk, but also completely happy to have my own time and give you space as well. \n\nMy budget can be flexible, and I'm open to joining an existing property or applying for a lease. I start January 10, but happy to take a lease earlier (ideally max 4 weeks but open to more for the right place) to move my stuff up and settle. Ideally an unfurnished place, but can probably part with some stuff if furnished. Attached or on-street parking is needed. \n\nI look forward to chatting to anyone further,\nCharlotte ♥ 	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-31 03:53:28.299	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-31 03:53:28.299	0

I work full-time at a timber yard and have a passion for art and design, freelancing as an illustrator and graphic designer in my spare time. With me is my boy Duke, a two-and-a-half-year-old Boston Terrier who’s all about the beach, playtime, and cuddles.\n\nI like to stay busy, but in my downtime, you’ll find me working on art, relaxing with a movie, or maybe playing some video games. Lately, I’ve been focusing more on fitness, enjoying swimming, running, and hitting the gym. I live minimally, keep things neat, and enjoy cooking. I don’t party much but I’m always up for a chill evening out or a night in with good movies.\n\nI’m looking for a comfortable spot with friendly, laid-back roommates who value both privacy and good company. If you think we’d be a good fit, I’d love to chat and see if your place might be right for me!	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-31 03:49:03.171	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-31 03:49:03.171	0

F4157988	Marius	$200/week•31 year old man	\N	G’day, mate! I’m Marius.\n\nI am coming over on a working holiday and am looking for a place to stay. Contrary to what my preferred locations may say, I don’t really have much of a preference for location, as long as there is easy access to the city. Nearby access to greenery for walks in a nice environment would be a big bonus, though knowing ye Aussies’ penchant for the green stuff I reckon that won’t be a problem.\n\nI tend to keep to myself, but would like to seize the opportunity to push myself into more social situations by living in a share house. I still recharge through quiet time and like working on projects I have, studying, or language-ogling – sometimes all at the same time – so I’m hoping to strike a nice balance. Other than that, I’m a fairly laid-back person and open for chats. I value cleanliness and am respectful of others’ personal space, and I hope to find housemates who share these qualities.\n\nAll in all, I fancy myself as someone who is easy to live with, and hope to find a comfy and relaxed living environment.	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-30 06:06:55.659	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-30 06:06:55.659	0

F3364540	Jemimah	$200/week•26 year old woman	\N	Hi! 🤍\n\nI am a positive and friendly full time veterinary student currently studying at the Adelaide University’s Roseworthy Campus. I also work part-time on both days on the weekend, so am super busy as you can imagine. 😂\n\nI study a lot, but also have interests such as reading, journaling, doing salsa classes once per week, horse riding, gym, walking/running and swimming at the beach. \n\nI love a chat, the occasional glass of wine and spending time with others. I also do like my downtime too, but would classify myself as more of an extrovert if I had to pick one. \n\nI have a gorgeous little cat called Luca who wins over everyone he meets with his happy, friendly, laid back demeanour, so I will need to find a space where I am able to bring him along too. He’s an indoor cat but we are getting braver on the harness, so he may be taking me on the occasional walk soon, who knows? 😂\n\nI am looking for a new home as sadly my current housemates and I aren’t able to renew our lease due to the owner selling. I have been so lucky to become friends with my current housemates and would like to find this in a new home, whilst still being respectful of people’s privacy and space. I’ll be looking to move into a new place in October. ☺️	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-31 03:49:29.762	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-31 03:49:29.762	0

Ideally, we are looking for somewhere in the Inner West or Inner East suburbs, so its close to our work space.\n\nIf we are not at the Commons, then we are either out enjoying a meal or having a quiet night over a book, some writing, or a new series. At the weekends we enjoy exploring, either for a hike or somewhere new, or we could be tempted by a free festival, especially if there is food!\n\nFor flat shares, our vibe is relaxed and friendly. We appreciate our downtime to recharge and will always respect your privacy, but we also enjoy having a casual chat and sharing how our day went. We’re looking for someone who values cleanliness like we do, as we believe a tidy home helps keep a clear mind. It’s important to us to live with someone who is considerate, easygoing, and respectful. We also appreciate open communication and a harmonious environment where everyone feels at home.	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-31 04:20:35.086	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-31 04:20:35.086	0

I’m really respectful of other people’s space and time so looking for someone likeminded to live with :) \n\nMessage me if you think I’d be a good addition to your home! 	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-31 04:20:31.018	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-31 04:20:31.018	0
F3905939	Greta	$270/week•20 year old woman	\N	 \nHi, I am looking for a room with a garden/small outside space whilst I study fulltime at ANU for myself and my small, friendly pup called Nala! I am mature, friendly and easy going person :)\n\nI am clean, tidy and I love to be social, however, I enjoy and understand the importance of having some personal space to unwind. I am looking for a social and friendly house share. \n\nI love movies, having a chat over a glass of wine, hiking and walks, reading and baking/cooking (especially making my own bread!)\n\nNala is a four year old small dog (Japanese spitz) who is very placid and wellbehaved as well as affectionate and toilet trained. When I am not home/when she is not with me, she loves to just relax on my bed (acts more like a cat)! She gets along well with cats (grown up with them) and most dogs. \n\nLooking around the inner North of Canberra (Braddon, Acton, Turner, O'Connor, Lyneham etc).  \n\nI am currently in a sharehouse (which is amazing!). However, the house is getting sold, and my housemates are graduating. I am looking to rent anytime from now and hoping to find something before Dec 10th. \n	\N	{}	\N	f	2024-10-31 04:20:31.018	f	0	0	0	0	{}	person	2024-10-31 04:20:31.018	0
